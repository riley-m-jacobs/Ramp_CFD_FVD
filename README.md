# Ramp_CFD_FVD
This repo is a finite volume implementation (specifically implementing the Linearized Riemann Solvers of Roe, HLLE, and HLLE+) for the inviscid and compressible euler equations. For more information as to the overarching goal read both the final project proposal as well as the final project. These solvers are written as short Matlab scripts and quick start is running the program under "main_driver.m." 

This is the first push on publishing my final project of my graduate level CFD course. For more information go to my website: rileymjacobs.com

This code was helped by referencing both (couldn't have done it without them!): wme7/ApproximateRiemannSolvers as well as tategill/CFD_FVM.
